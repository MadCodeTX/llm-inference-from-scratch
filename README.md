# llm-inference-from-scratch

Educational, dissected LLM inference in Python + PyTorch. Every mechanism is
built by hand first (matmul/softmax attention, hand-parsed safetensors headers,
a toy paged KV allocator), then compared with the optimized library path.
No training framework, no `generate()` black box: the point is to see the wires.

## The Tiny-to-Qwen ladder

1. **Tiny** — a 2-layer, `d_model<=64` decoder trained on nothing; random weights,
   byte tokens. Small enough to print every tensor shape in a test.
2. **Small** — same code, character/BPE tokens, longer contexts; sampling and
   KV-cache equivalence (cache vs no-cache must match token-for-token greedy).
3. **Real weights** — load a Hugging Face `config.json` + safetensors checkpoint
   (Llama/Qwen architecture family) into the same `DecoderLM` via an explicit
   weight-name mapping. Start with the smallest available Qwen checkpoint.
4. **Qwen-class / Glimmer** — read the real `config.json` of a large model
   (e.g. a 27B-class Qwen deployment) *from disk at load time*; never hard-code
   its numbers here. Reason about its KV-cache bytes, quantization, and serving
   cost with chapters 10-11 even when it cannot run on this machine.

One codebase climbs the whole ladder: only `ModelConfig` and the weights change.

## Setup

```bash
cd llm-inference-from-scratch
uv venv && uv pip install -e ".[hf]" --group dev   # if uv is available
# fallback (no uv):
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[hf,dev]"
```

On a CPU-only box, install CPU torch first if the default wheel is too large:
`.venv/bin/pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`

## Test

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest        # or: uv run pytest
```

Tests use tiny dims (`d_model<=64`, `n_layer<=2`) and run fast on CPU.

## Demo

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
.venv/bin/python scripts/demo_generate.py   # tiny char LM: train, generate, cache==no-cache check
.venv/bin/python scripts/benchmark.py       # prefill vs decode throughput
```

## Status

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Scaffold (layout, contract, roadmap) | done |
| Code chapters 00-11 (`config` … `serving`) | implemented; tests passing (see below) |
| Chapter 12 (optimizations) | read-only dissection in `docs/12_optimizations.md`; no code changes by design |
| Teaching docs 00-12 + glossary | written; every internal link verified to exist |
| Qwen weight loading | machinery implemented + tested on hand-built checkpoints (`weights.py`: hand-parsed safetensors headers, `load_hf_config`, `map_hf_state_dict`, `validate_state_dict`); not yet run against a downloaded real checkpoint on this machine — config numbers are always read from the real `config.json` at load time |

Verified: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` → **96 passed** (tiny CPU dims). Independently re-checked: greedy cache vs no-cache tokens identical (MHA/GQA/MQA + learned-pos variants), HF-rename roundtrip logits identical (`max_abs_diff 0.0`), `scripts/demo_generate.py` prints a sample and `scripts/benchmark.py` prints tokens/s. Honest gaps: no real Qwen checkpoint has been downloaded/run here, and chapter 12's fast paths (FlashAttention, torch.compile, speculative decoding) are analyzed, not integrated — the manual implementations remain the reference. On this tiny CPU model the no-cache path can time faster than the cached path (overhead dominates); the cache's win grows with sequence length and model size.
